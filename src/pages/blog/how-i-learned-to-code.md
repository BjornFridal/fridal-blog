## How I learned to code

My friend is considering a career change. He is currrently a highschool teacher, but has been dabling with web development on the sideline. Hence he wants to move into the glorious tech industry. The last job he applied for there were more than 300 qualified applicants! He didn't get the job. I, on the other hand, get so many LinkedIn job requests that I considered deleting my account.

My friend naturally has a lot of questions about how I got started as a developer, what schools I attended etc. Since he is a teacher it shouldn't come as a surprise that he inquiring about my academic background. The truth is, I have none! Sure I finished highschool, but it weren't pretty!

I used to be a bit embarrassed when someone probed me about my educational merits, but these days I find it comforting that there is more than one way to a career in tech.
