text: 'As a result of the GDPR rules I was put in charge of creating an on-premise newsletter application for Rigsrevisionen. Previously the organization had used an email marketing system hosted in the cloud. Now to maintain full control of the data everything was moved in-house. I built an application that gave the webeditors the tools to compose newsletters from predefined content elements. I was also in charge of implementing the backend which leveraged a queuing system to scale the solution and handle massive amounts of emails.'
