text: 'I was in charge of creating a range of loan calculator widgets. The widgets were built on top of a loan calculator that I had previously developed for Express Bank. Each widget had a unique set of features. All of the widgets should easily be embedded into the websites of the bank’s partners. Enabling the partners to offer loan to their customers directly from the partner’s own website.'
