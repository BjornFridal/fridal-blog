__text: 'As the lead frontend developer I helped Rigsrevisionens IT department to develop a time tracking application which replaced a legacy Silverlight application. The new application is used by the organizationâ€™s employees to track the time they spend on each of their projects. The application integrates with a number of other systems to provide relevant data to the end user and thereby gives a seamless user experience.'
